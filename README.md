# Overview

This is just a working Arch Linux Emacs configuration. 

I'm keeping track of it so I can potentially use it on other Linux systems.

# Setup

You will need to create an .emacs.d directory in your home directory. Then clone the contents of this repo into that directory.

So it will look like:

```
~/.emacs.d
|
|->init.el
|->/elpa
    |
    |-> all the packages
```
